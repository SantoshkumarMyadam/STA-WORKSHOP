To understand timing its important we have a indepth knowledge regarding internal structure of LATCH and FLIPFLOP.
The basic timing parameters setup and hold depends on its internal structure.We generally find other representation in book but the below diagram represents simplest form of latch and flip-flop.

we know that flops and latches are available in different flavours,due to which internal inverters have different delays and hence setup and hold timings are different.
