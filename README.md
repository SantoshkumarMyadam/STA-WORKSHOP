# STA-WORKSHOP TIMING OF LATCH and FLIPFLOP
To understand timing its important we have a indepth knowledge regarding internal structure of LATCH.
The basic timing parameters setup and hold depends on its internal structure.We generally find other representation in book but the below diagram represents simplest form of latch and flip-flop.

Basically setup time is time required for data to reach from Dpin to Q point in flop/latch.
similarly Hold is time required to off the transmission gate of flop.latch.
we know that flops and latches are available in different flavours,due to which internal inverters have different delays and hence setup and hold timings are different.
